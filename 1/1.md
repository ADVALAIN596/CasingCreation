## Goal
Test conversion from FreeCAD to OpenSCAD

## Related goals: 

2: Test conversion from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD

## Experiment

 * In FreeCAD, create one flat piece of woord, size 160x100x3 mm, save it as 'source'.
 * Export it to OpenSCAD file 'target.scad'
 * Examine 'target.scad' in OpenSCAD

## Observations

 * In FreeCAD
    * I created a Sketch and saved it as 'source.fcstd' and 'source.fcstd1'
    * I added the third dimension by padding it with 3 mm
    * converting it to .scad fails with errors, see 'Appendix 1: Error message 1'
    * converting it to .stl works, see 'Appendix 2: Screenshot 1'
    * I threw away the part, I made it three dimensional with 'Create a ruled surface' on the opposing edges, then extruding by 3 mm
    * converting it to .scad fails with errors, see 'Error message 1'
    * converting it to .stl 'target2.stl' works 
 * Perhaps importing the STL in OpenSCAD works? 
   * Nope, cannot import an STL in OpenSCAD
 
The state of OpenSCAD exports is unsure, but there is no evidence it is compled, see 'Appendix 3: Forum Thread 1'.

### Appendix 2: Screenshot 1

Proves that export to STL works:

### Appendix 3: Forum thread 1 
[According to the forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2395&p=17777&hilit=export+scad+openscad+import#p17777) FreeCAD does not support
export to OpenSCAD:

```
Export FreeCAD to OpenSCAD CSG.

I have started an exporter for FreeCAD to OpenSCAD CSG format.

Its available at http://www.sloan-home.co.uk/Export/Export.html

shoogen I think you are getting way way ahead of the game.

The long term plan is to produce an export for CSG and also an export for SCAD, but thats a long term aim,
At the moment I intend to concentrate on export CSG
