## Goal
Test conversion from FreeCAD to OpenSCAD

I expect that this works, as I can select this in FreeCAD. I expect FreeCAD to generate a file similar to one of the options in 'Appendix 5: expected target.scad'.

2: Test conversion from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD

See [there](../2/2.md).

## Experiment

 * In FreeCAD, create one flat piece of woord, size 160x100x3 mm, save it as 'source'.
 * Export it to OpenSCAD file 'target.scad'
 * Examine 'target.scad' in OpenSCAD

## Observations

 * In FreeCAD
    * I created a Sketch and saved it as 'source.fcstd' and 'source.fcstd1'
    * I added the third dimension by padding it with 3 mm
    * converting it to .scad has two results: either an error message 'Appendix 1: Error message 1', later it created a near-empty file 'target.scad' (see 'Appendix 4: near-empty file target.scad')
    * converting it to .stl works, see 'Appendix 2: Screenshot 1'
    * I threw away the part, I made it three dimensional with 'Create a ruled surface' on the opposing edges, then extruding by 3 mm
    * converting it to .scad fails with errors, see 'Error message 1'
    * converting it to .stl 'target.stl' works 
 * Perhaps importing the STL in OpenSCAD works? 
   * Nope, cannot import an STL in OpenSCAD
 
The state of OpenSCAD exports is unsure, but there is no evidence it is compled, see 'Appendix 3: Forum Thread 1'.

I posted this error on the FreeCAD forum, [here](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=6803&p=0&e=0&sid=9893721e94c8a15394860cd022dc6d39).

### Appendix 2: Screenshot 1

Proves that export to STL works:

### Appendix 3: Forum thread 1 
[According to the forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2395&p=17777&hilit=export+scad+openscad+import#p17777) FreeCAD does not support
export to OpenSCAD:

```
Export FreeCAD to OpenSCAD CSG.

I have started an exporter for FreeCAD to OpenSCAD CSG format.

Its available at http://www.sloan-home.co.uk/Export/Export.html

shoogen I think you are getting way way ahead of the game.

The long term plan is to produce an export for CSG and also an export for SCAD, but thats a long term aim,
At the moment I intend to concentrate on export CSG
```

### Appendix 4: near-empty file target.scad

```
// CSG file generated from FreeCAD Export 0.1c
group() {
 group(){
}
}

### Appendix 5: expected target.scad

```
//Create the cuboid, on of its points is at origin
cube([160,100,3]);
```

or

```
//Create the cuboid, center on origin
cube([160,100,3],center=true);
```


or

```
//Create the cuboid, translate its center to origin
translate([-80,-50,-1.5]) { cube([160,100,3]); }
```
