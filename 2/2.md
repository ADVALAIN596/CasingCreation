# 2: Test conversion from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD

## Goal

Test conversion from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD

I expect that this works, as FreeCAD has an OpenSCAD mode. In this experiment I will not use that environment: I will create the file in OpenSCAD.

## Related goals: 

 * [1: Test conversion from FreeCAD to OpenSCAD](../1/1.md)

## Experiment

 * In OpenSCAD, create a cuboid, size 160x100x3 mm, save it as 'source'.
 * In FreeCAD, start the 'OpenSCAD' Workbench, load 'source.scad', export to target.fcstd
 * In FreeCAD, open 'target.fcstd'
 * In FreeCAD, export it to OpenSCAD again

## Observations

 * In OpenSCAD, create a cuboid, size 160x100x3 mm, save it as 'source'.

 * In FreeCAD, export it to OpenSCAD again

cube (size = [160.0, 100.0, 3.0], center = true);
}
}
}
```
