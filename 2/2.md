## Goal

2: Test conversion from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD

I expect that this works, as FreeCAD has an OpenSCAD mode. In this experiment I will not use that environment: I will create the file in OpenSCAD.

## Related goals: 

 * Test conversion from FreeCAD to OpenSCAD: See [there](../1/1.md).
 * Test conversion from OpenSCAD (within FreeCAD) to FreeCAD: See [there](../3/3.md).

## Experiment

 * In OpenSCAD, create a cuboid, size 160x100x3 mm, save it as 'source'.
 * In FreeCAD, open it
